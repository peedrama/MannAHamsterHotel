We used html, bootstrap, and css to recreate the Hamster Hotel Website from a designer's awesome prototype

Peer reviewed by Mark Ramirez: "Every thing looks perfect on desktop and mobile the only thing i think looks wierd is the amenaties maybe 2x2 grid instead of the 1x4 would look better you could probably do that supper easy"
